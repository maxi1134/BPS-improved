"""Persistent storage for BPS layout + calibration state.

The floor/zone/receiver layout and the calibration state used to live as flat
files in ``www/bps_maps`` (``bpsdata.txt`` / ``bps_calibration_state.json``),
written with ``open(path, "w")`` — which truncates to zero *before* writing, so
an interrupted write left a 0-byte file and wiped the config (issue #104).
Being under ``www/`` also made them readable unauthenticated via ``/local/``.

Both now live in Home Assistant's ``Store`` (``config/.storage/``):
``Store.async_save`` writes atomically (temp file + ``os.replace`` — the live
file is never truncated), and ``.storage`` is not web-served. This module is
the single owner of that data and imports nothing from the rest of the package
(so both ``__init__`` and ``calibration`` can import it without a cycle).
