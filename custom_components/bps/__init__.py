# (state [x, y, vx, vy]) instead of a fixed-length moving average. Unlike the
# old 3-sample mean, the filter carries a motion model, so it lags less while a
# tracker is walking and settles more while it is still, and it adapts its gain
# to the estimated uncertainty rather than weighting every past fix equally.
#
# The noise parameters are defined in METRES (and metres/second) and converted
# into each floor's pixel space via the floor scale, so the filter behaves the
# same on maps of any resolution. They are deliberately "trusting": BPS already
# reads Bermuda's smoothed rssi_distance (20-sample average + velocity gate), so
# the trilateration fixes fed in here are not raw-RSSI noisy. Tune KF_MEAS_NOISE_M
# up for more smoothing, or KF_ACCEL_NOISE_MS2 up for a snappier response.

# the panel, the vertical leg is removed before trilateration
# (horizontal = sqrt(slant^2 - dz^2)). Trackers are assumed to be carried at

# When a floor's fit lands in one of its no-go zones the fit is impossible on
# THAT floor, so its election confidence is multiplied down: the competition
# then prefers the floor where the same spot is a real room (the open space
# means that floor's receivers already hear the tracker and solve it as a

    known_points are (x, y, r) or (x, y, r, w) tuples. The optional w is a
    per-point reliability in [0, 1] (1 = fully trusted); it multiplies the
    geometric 1/r^2 weight, so a spiky reading pulls the fit less without being
    dropped. Missing w defaults to 1.

    bounds, when given as (minx, miny, maxx, maxy), constrains the solution to
    the floor's extent: the fit then finds the best position WITHIN the map,
    which lands on the boundary when an unconstrained fit would escape it.

    min_weight_radius clamps the radius used in the 1/r^2 WEIGHT (never the
    residual). Callers pass a physical floor in pixels (MIN_WEIGHT_RADIUS_M x
    floor scale): a near-zero radius — device at the receiver, or a slant range
    fully consumed by a known mount height — is an honest reading, but its
    weight must stay finite or that single receiver decides the whole fit. The
    default keeps the bare no-scale fallback safe against division by zero.
