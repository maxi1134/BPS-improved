"""Receiver auto-calibration from probe-to-probe BLE measurements.

Each ESPHome probe advertises an iBeacon from the same Bluetooth MAC its
scanner uses, so every sibling probe ranges it and Bermuda accumulates the
measurements on the scanner's own device — for all devices, tracked or not.
The bermuda.dump_devices service exposes those adverts with raw distances.

Combined with the receivers' known positions on the floor plan (and the
floor's pixels-per-meter scale) this yields a measured-vs-true matrix over
receiver pairs. A robust least-squares fit decomposes the log-space error
into a receive-side bias per receiver (rx) and a transmit-side bias per
beacon (tx):

    log10(measured_ij / true_ij) ~= rx_j + tx_i

The per-receiver correction factor 10^(-rx_j) multiplies every distance that
receiver reports (see update_receiver_radii). Because Bermuda's distance
model is exponential in RSSI, a multiplicative distance factor is exactly
equivalent to an additive per-scanner RSSI offset, so nothing is lost by
correcting in distance space. Corrections are normalized to a geometric mean
of 1: they encode only how receivers differ from each other. A bias shared by
the whole fleet is dominated by the beacons' TX power, which says nothing
about the phones and watches actually being tracked — applying it would
uniformly rescale every tracker distance and shift all positions (learned the
hard way: zones all went "unknown" the moment the first corrections landed).
